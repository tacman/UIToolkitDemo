# Scripted Menu Demo

The project demonstrates how to create and use a menu created from xml, css and a c# script.

Eventually those elements will be in a prefab in the Asset Store, maybe Modern Menu 2?

## Setup

Since UI Toolkit is still in preview, and it is **not** in the Asset Store yet, installing it is tricky.  But follow these instructions:

Open the Package Manager, go to Unity Registry, and add UI Builder
Then click on the + in the upper left, and click Add from Github.  This is the secret way to add a package (which isn't in github!), and add "com.unity.ui".  This will install [].
